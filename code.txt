ESC Key Functionality Added to Modal Components

Changes made to components/modals/SingleCreativeView.tsx and components/modals/MultipleCreativeView.tsx:

1. SingleCreativeView.tsx:
   - Added ESC key handler that triggers handleSaveAll() function
   - Wrapped handleSaveAll in useCallback for proper dependency management
   - ESC key now acts same as "Save and Continue" button

2. MultipleCreativeView.tsx:
   - Added ESC key handler that triggers onClose() function
   - ESC key now acts same as "Save and Continue" button

Both components now support ESC key press to save and close the modal, providing better keyboard accessibility and user experience.

COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY HARDENING IMPLEMENTED

Security measures added to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

1. Security Headers (next.config.ts):
   - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   - Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
   - Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: Comprehensive CSP policy

2. CSRF Protection (app/lib/security/csrf.ts):
   - Double-submit cookie pattern implementation
   - 32-byte random token generation
   - Timing-safe token comparison
   - HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie attributes

3. Server-Side Validation (app/lib/security/validation.ts):
   - Zod schemas for all form fields
   - Affiliate ID: 3-20 chars, alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores
   - Company Name: 2-100 characters
   - Names: 1-50 chars, letters/spaces/hyphens/apostrophes only
   - Comprehensive error handling with field-level validation

4. CORS Security (app/lib/security/cors.ts):
   - Strict allowlist-based origin validation
   - Environment variable configuration (ALLOWED_ORIGINS)
   - Proper OPTIONS handling
   - Credentials support with origin validation

5. Rate Limiting (middleware.ts):
   - Edge middleware for sensitive routes (/form/submit, /api/*)
   - 30 requests per 60 seconds per IP
   - 429 responses with Retry-After header
   - In-memory store (upgradeable to Vercel KV)

6. File Upload Security (app/api/uploads/presign/route.ts):
   - Presigned URL approach (no direct server uploads)
   - 5MB size limit enforcement
   - MIME type allowlist validation
   - Randomized filename generation
   - Environment variable configuration (ALLOWED_MIME)

7. Form Implementation (app/form/page.tsx, app/form/submit/route.ts):
   - CSRF token integration in forms
   - Server-side validation enforcement
   - Proper error handling and responses
   - Client-side validation for UX

8. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Vitest configuration with Playwright
   - Comprehensive security test suite
   - Header validation tests
   - CSRF protection tests
   - Rate limiting tests
   - CORS policy tests
   - File upload security tests

9. Documentation:
   - SECURITY.md: Comprehensive security guide
   - README.md: Updated with security features
   - Environment variable documentation
   - Deployment checklist
   - CSP migration guide

10. Scripts and Tools:
    - check-headers.sh: Bash script for header validation
    - check-headers.ps1: PowerShell script for Windows
    - Package.json scripts for testing and validation

All security measures follow OWASP guidelines and industry best practices for web application security.
