ESC Key Functionality Added to Modal Components

Changes made to components/modals/SingleCreativeView.tsx and components/modals/MultipleCreativeView.tsx:

1. SingleCreativeView.tsx:
   - Added ESC key handler that triggers handleSaveAll() function
   - Wrapped handleSaveAll in useCallback for proper dependency management
   - ESC key now acts same as "Save and Continue" button

2. MultipleCreativeView.tsx:
   - Added ESC key handler that triggers onClose() function
   - ESC key now acts same as "Save and Continue" button

Both components now support ESC key press to save and close the modal, providing better keyboard accessibility and user experience.
